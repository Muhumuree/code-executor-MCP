## 🌟 What is Code Executor MCP?

Code Executor MCP is an easy-to-use application that helps you manage multiple tools without hassle. It reduces your token usage by up to 98% and offers a secure, isolated environment to run your code. With seamless access to various tools, you can streamline your tasks and enhance productivity.

## 🛠 Features

- **Token Savings:** Load just one executor instead of managing multiple tools, significantly lowering your token costs.
- **Secure Execution:** All code runs in a sandboxed environment. This means it is secure and isolated from your main system. By default, it does not have internet access, ensuring your data stays safe.
- **User-Friendly Setup:** You don’t need to spend time configuring settings. The built-in wizard automatically detects existing MCP servers.
- **Code Generation:** Automatically generated TypeScript and Python SDKs make it easy to develop your applications with full IntelliSense support.
